                        <p>You’re our guest when you shop with us, so we design every Target shopping experience to be the best you’ll ever have. From CityTarget stores that are right-sized and stocked for urban dwellers to an award-winning iPhone app that lets you shop on the go, your Target shopping experience will be unique and memorable.</p>
						<p>We set high standards for your Target experience—where you shop with us and in our company halls. We aim to be a place where guests and team members will always find more than they expect. Our purpose and beliefs set the stage, and day-to-day innovation, teamwork and community partnerships reflect who we are.</p>
